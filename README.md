https://brax.gg/project-1-create-your-own-private-blockchain/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=project-1-create-your-own-private-blockchain ; 
in order to understand how connect the testnet bitcoin, but on the final of day I used this https://reinproject.org/bitcoin-signature-tool/#sign site to create the signature.
